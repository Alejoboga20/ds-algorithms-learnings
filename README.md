# Interview Prep

This repository contains my learnings during my interview preparation. I'll be adding the code snippets and notes as I learn them.

I'll be following the content from the books `Grokking Algorithms` by `Aditya Bhargava` and `Grokking Data Structures` by `Marcello La Rocca` along with some other resources like leetcode, geeksforgeeks, etc.
